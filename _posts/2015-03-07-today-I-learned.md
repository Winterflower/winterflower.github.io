title: Today I learned
---

Some things I learned today:

* I still suck at working with Git on shared repositories. Merge conflicts, arrgh! In particular I need to improve in the 
following scenarios: (1) Knowing how to pull correctly when someone has pushed changes to a remote repo 
in the same branch that I am using. (2) Establishing an effective workflow for developing new
features without messing up the main branch

* Setting up even a simple app with Flask is way beyond me.

* Something about Python decorators

* A Python Flask app process does not die when I execute the standard kill <pid>

* The `with` statement in Python
