title: high-octane dreams
---

_I started writing this essay several months before
the coronavirus pandemic. If this imagined life seemed
unattainable back then, its glossy exterior has certainly
been completely shattered by now._

In an alternative universe, things are, 
of course different. And glossy. 

I planned the rest of my life one afternoon in 7th grade
while reading an elementary Swedish language textbook.
A staple piece of content in foreign language textbooks
at the time were snippets where students of the same age 
as the learners but living in the native country where the foreign
language was spoken talk about their dreams for the future. 

It was then and there that I read the dreams of Janika, 13,
from Uppsala, who imagined herself at 30, sitting in a luxury
bath in her apartment in London, relaxing after a long day at work.
After completing highschool, Janika moved to London and made
a successful career in business. It was vague and suitably delicious.

Right then and there, on the wooden classroom chairs,
this sounded like magic and for months after that I slipped in
and out of random reveries of what it would be like to lead this 
high-flying existence in a specific, yet unnamed,
cosmopolitan city in the world.

There would of course be busy mornings, large Chanel
sunglasses and tall single-use coffee cups.
One would glide into the office a la Miranda Priestly,
the bossbitch devil wearing Prada, her morning
entrace accompanied by the staccatto of heels
on well-polished marble floors in the lobby
of an anonymous but important looking office.

At other times, the reveries were about evenings after work,
slipping into luxe baths in beautiful Scandinavian
bathrooms with views into expansive living rooms.
In those living rooms, the windows stretched from floor to
ceiling and revealed a jeweled carpet of city lights
stretching infinitely into all directions. 

All of this obviously took place before I ever laid
my eyes on the New York-London-Paris
real-estate listings and even after I had laid eyes on
the said information and computed the gap between
what I could ever expect to earn in a lifetime and what one
of these glamorous places cost, I still continued dreaming.

Of course, the imagined version of my future self did
other things besides taking baths and wistfully
gazing out of tall, expansive windows. 

There were nights out in chandeliered bars where the light
was just dim enough to be sophisticated, yet intimate,
where the decor refused to place itself in any particular era
or style but was anonymous, where the conversation was interesting
yet didn't say much and mingled among the light glint of
piano, where people flirted by dropping references
to an art exhibition of Picasso's early works or this or that
indie band they had seen perform in a hip area of the city that they loved being
associated with but would never consider living in.

Then there were of course the weekends and here the dream's
geographies became vague. These days were occupied with
shopping trips to other equally stylish, equally expensive,
equally charming comsopolitan cities where glamorous,
rich, beautiful people drifted from one chic pastel
store to another buying things just because they could
and not because they needed any of them. It was this
air of casual nonchalance, of buying things
just for the sake of buying that became so seductive.
It seemed like the ultimate form of some perverted freedom.
Of course, it was also a trap.

At other times, there were trips to the sea
and the seaside mansions, whose total worth would
by far exceed anything a whole town of people could ever earn in a lifetime.
In the yards of these mansions, the occupants sat by the pool,
barbecued and made arrangements to play golf together
on the bank holiday weekend. They all had the air of people
who had succeeded and would succeeded with seemingly little
or no effort. The way they did it, they made success look easy. 

Once the dusk had settled, there would be a garden party
in the warm, balmy light of the evening, the air saturated
with the excitement and exhaustion from the day's activities,
and the guests, in their summer whites, drifting from 
one conversation to another like large moths.

Of courses, this was all pretty much like the 
Instagram reel of an affluent person.
No one around me lived a life quite as exquisite
as I spent hours imagining, yet for some reason
these images and their variants came to occupy my imagination,
eventually occupying the very dangerous label of
desireable life. 

It was desireable on some abstract social one-upmanship level, 
a life that everyone was primed to strive for since
the very early days of pre-school, not
necessarily a desireable life in terms of social
benefit or even individual liberty.
After all, paying for all of the above would likely
require golden handcuffs or some sort of familial
monetary lifeline. 


Although these images situate themselves in various places, 
continents, cities, places of a certain feeling and 
no concrete geographical label, a common thread weaves 
through these images, namely that they derive their
pleasure and thus their allure from the possbility
of unlimited consumption, wealth and prosperity.
They are (in the words of a climate change activist) affordances
of a high-carbon society, high-octane dreams.
