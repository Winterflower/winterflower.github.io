Two people, two senior leaders in technology whose work I follow and repect, recently had an inflamed public exchange on Twitter, which made my heart sink. The exchange was about a piece of advice that one of them had published for women in technology - 'women in tech' as the movement is usually known. I read the post, not once, but several times. I didn't agree with all of it. I thought some of it was problematic, the other part practical. It seemed like advice that actually acknowledges that the real working world is not always a nice, fair, just place and I appreciated it for its candor. But advice is just that advice. It's not a how-to manual or a guaranteed way to succeed in an industry. It's often based on the author's own experiences or the experiences of those she has worked with or mentored. 

I wanted to share some of thoughts on the platform and initially retweeted a few posts and commented, but after a while I gave up and deleted the lot.
I don't know what value I can add beyond restating what other people have already said. 
It reminds of the time another prominent develop (who happens to be a woman) criticised some women in tech groups. There was lots of unnecessary hand-wringing and hot takes. But also a few well-measured responses. If we as 'women in tech' can't take a critical look at our movement and its aims and can't tolerate scrutiny from people who don't agree with out goals, then what are we really doing. 

Also, I'm just tired of talking about this. Actions speak louder than tweets or words.
So that's what I'm going to focus on.
