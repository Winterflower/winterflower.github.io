# What can a technologist do about climate change?

It is 22:14. The 23rd of August, 2016. The days are starting to get shorter, the nights slightly longer.
It is 22:14 at night and it is hot. 
Someone has aimed a hot hair dryer at London and kept it running all day.
Even as the sun set for the day, the exhausted, tired air of the city kept shimmering from the heat. 

We are breaking records. In sports, on stadiums and in pools. And in statistics.
[This July was the hottest month recorded since recordkeeping began](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/science/how-hot-was-it-in-july-hotter-than-ever.html). 

This Tuesday, the tally was 89 to 78. The residents of Shishmaref, an Inupiat community on the island of Sarichef off the coast of Alaska voted to move, because the land they had inhabited for centuries has become too unstable due to the effects of climate change. 

If you are worried about this and wonder what you as a techie/software engineer/concerned technically-minded citizen can do, I encourage you to read Bret Victor's ["What can a technologist do about climate change?"](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/).
