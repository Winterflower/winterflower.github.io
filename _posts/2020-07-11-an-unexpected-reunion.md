_Draft extracts from a novel I started writing around 2012-2013._

Two day's after Kitty's death, we gathered at Anne's.
It would have been exactly like in college had we not
been in our early 30s, lackluster with the unflattering
patina of adulting, and of course for the gaping
absence of Kitty. 

Leila had flown in from Colorado, Sheryl from London
and I drove down from New York where I'd ended up after
a few unsuccessful years trying to grow new roots
in places that sounded chic but soon gave way
to bouts of extreme loneliness, places with names like London, Stockholm and Paris. 

Life had scattered us apart in more ways than physical distance
and this sudden death had brought us back into close proximity.
We sat on the patio of Anne's suburban Pennsylvania McMansion,
drank margaritas and popped some of the pills Sheryl had produced
from her Birkin.

To be honest, all of us had been in love with Kitty
one way or another. But it was a toxic kind of love,
the love one might imagine an ugly woman (or any woman really these days) feels for the
photoshopped images in Vogue editorials.

In all of our imaginations, in the curated glimpses that we received of
her post-college life, we saw everything that we had hoped to become
and didn't. 

I reclined on the sofa and tried to conjure an image
of Kitty as I remembered her from the first day of college.
Light brown bangs, lavender dress, long slender legs
that would soon land her modeling gigs in New York, and
Oxford shoes. The kind I imagined she wore when on
weekend trips to the summer house in the Hamptons. 

I think we - all of us - or me, maybe just me, could have forgiven her
her looks, her slender modelesque frame, the inexhaustible
and steady supply of money she came from, had she been at least
average at something. 

But Kitty was ahead of the curve, ahead of the game,
in every possible way: stellar grades, good at sports, excellent
at dance, lead in school plays. 

Well, there had been one way where she was found wanting.
Between her front teeth was a large, very noticeable gap. The kind
that instantly knocked a few years off her age and gave her an air
of eternal innocense.

You had to get that fixed too, didn't you, I thought
into my margarita. It was getting cold on the patio
or maybe it was just the company.

Braces for the first 8 months of her freshman year
and then she had become truly perfect. 

"How's Will doing? Has anyone checked up on him?
We really ought to. He must be devastated, poor thing."

The voice belonged to Sheryl.
She had come straight from the airport after her red eye,
but her hair was unruffled, her suit without so much as an 
errant wrinkle and her eyes well-rested, which made me think
she had splurged on a first class. 
She had been carefully avoiding me since she had stepped into
the house.

We hadn't seen each other since the summer after college 
when I had broken it off with her in a very public 
confrontation. A very public confrontation that was
diametrically opposed to the well-manicured perfection
that she usually was. She would never forgive me and I
wasn't looking for it either. 


"He's taking the kids to Connecticut. His parents
are going to take care of them for a while."

I have, of course, neglected to mention the children, the husband. And
the marriage. The marriage in which my misery and heartbreak
became crystallised and on display. 

I feel that it would be cheating to start there, though.
To start there and not go to the beginning where the 
the threads of life first started intersecting in ways that
we would find hard to untangle later.
