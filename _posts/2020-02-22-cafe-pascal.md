_I was too nervous of taking a photo in cafe pascal,
so I took one of a frozen pastry and my coffee mug at home._


Even though third time's the charm, I almost didn't make into
Cafe Pascal this time either - the third attempt. All of this,
because at some point during my years in London, I had developed
an anxiety about entering busy coffee shops and
frantically searching for a place to park my inelegant body,
while the elegant, well-dressed people at the tables have me pitiful glances
in between taking bites of their avocado toasts and ardent concentration
on ignoring the waves of disturbance in the ambience. 
Of course, a large part of this reality existed solely in my head, but 
it didn't make the anxiety resulting from these images any less real.

So on my first two attempts I'd let anxiety win. I'd walked past
the cafe, giving, casual, nonchalant glances at the glass windows to
see how crowded it was. It was crowded, there was a queue, just like
the past two times. I made a loop on the street, pretending I was lost
instead of indecisive, checking my watch, even though I had no interest
in the time, but pretending, to anyone watching, that I was waiting for a friend
on this nondescript street branching off of Odenplan in Stockholm.
Then finally, I opened the door and went inside. 

It was warm inside, the air peppered with a lively buzz of 
conversation, with cosmopolitan mixes of accented English,
and the gentle tinkle of china and silverware
as tea and coffee cups were lowered and then picked up again
by people enjoying a Saturday morning coffee.

The interior style was a bit of everything and not exactly anything.
Rustic, but not full-blown countryhouse-en-Provence rustic,
scandichic, but not overly clinical and airport-asceptic,
hygge, but not too many knitted sweaters and fluffyy woollen socks,
shabbychic yet also somehow neat and new.
It wasn't committed to any extreme. It was lagom, just right, 
as the Swedish tend to say. 

I waited for my turn and stumbled over the Swedish words
necessary to order an oat milk latte (yes, I am one of those
people whose Starbucks orders contain more coffee dressing than
actual caffeine bearing substance and you are free to heckle me for it)
and a semla - a seasonal Mardi Gras pastry (though it's sold starting
January through to Easter), sliced into two pieces and filled with
almost paste (_mandelmassa_) and whipped cream. 

No one wore plaid or asked me whether I'd prefer one arcane roast
over another (even though looking at the drinks menu, coffee
connoisseurs would love it here) while rolling their eyes at my blank
stare and pleibian tastes in coffee (I once made the mistake of 
saying "Whichever" to a question like that at Alchemy in London 
and received a very disapproving eyeroll, but that's a story 
for another time). 

One of the baristas had a manbun (not uncommon in the streets of
Stockholm) and looked like an Australian surfer-dude who could at any point
surprise you by interspersing a g'day mate in between his Swedish. 

I sat at one of the large communal tables opposite the coffee counter - the
perfect vantage point for sampling the atmosphere. People
walked by in large, puffy down coats and overly large woollen cardigans.
The style here had a definite air of hygge sprezzatura - a careful
carelessness meets shabbychic and your grandma's closet. Oversized
knitted sweaters were paired with skintight yoga pants and vintage
Chanelesque clutches. But beneath all of this nordic bohemianism
ran a whiff of wealth, carefully channeled into an inconspicuous style.

One might call this style a Stockholm version
of the bobo (short for bohemian bourgeoisie) parisienne.
This person, often female, fluttered in and out of the pages
of Parisian and wannabe-Parisian fashion magazines, talked
about Sartre and Bauhaus on lifestyle YouTube channels while
showing us her carefully careless 20-step French skincare routine
and effortlessly elegant 2 million dollar 16th arrodissement 
apartment. The Swedish version would probably be called
the _sofo stockholmare_. Sofo, to imitate the iconic chic names of
places like SoHo and NoLita, denoted a particular, gentrifying area in the 
south of Stockholm, where teslas and hipsters mingled with art studios
and design agencies. 


From my community table, I observed elegant, lithe women with
perfectly trimmed bobs and well fitting turtlenecks engagaed in
lively conversations with friends and partners and I imagined
that most of their life was set against a backdrop of elegant places
like these that served avocado toast and V60 while they 
and those arround them discussed promotions, examined enagament rings
and planned stylish, expensive vacations. 

I immediately felt out of place. My wardrobe was (still is)
mostly what I'd had in London. I'd spent a good chunk
of my career working in places that did not have a relaxed, careless attitude about
dressing. As a result, neither did my wardrobe. 
Whatever I was wearing looked, here, like I was trying too hard,
like I'd dressed for a job interview to come to a cafe and
write, like I didn't belong. 

To add insult to injury, the easy availability of pastries hadn't helped my billowing wasteline
much either and some ugly spectres from my previous battles with my body
started to rear their ugly heads. 

Just as these thoughts started to swirl in my mind, my neck protested against 
the cramped writing conditions at the table and I packed up and left
for the commuter train back to the suburbs.
