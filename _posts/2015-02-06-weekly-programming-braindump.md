# The Weekly Programming Braindump

* Sebastian Rashka has written an interesting [post](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_multiprocessing_intro.html)
on parallel programming with Python

* When you are designing a Python method (aka function) that involves file IO,
is it "better" (in whatever way a programmer may choose to define better) to
pass the file as a filename (string) to the method and let the method take care
of opening the file or is better to pass it as a file object and do the whole
opening conundrum in the client calling the method/function

* I started learning about tuple spaces and tuple space programming

* I learned something about blocking and non-blocking IO in Java, but
I can't say I could explain it to someone else. Must do more research.

* I started using PyCharm and downloaded Spyder. The weekend should be
called "Fun with IDEs"

* I am planning to write a Spyder plugin for bioinformaticians. That is,
as soon as I learn how to use Spyder

* I started learning about limit order books in finance and started writing
my own limit order book simulation based on the `orderbook` package in R

* I just completed the data harvesting phase for my London Tube Simulation and
I could not be more excited about it!

* I was inspired by KDB+ and Q (I can't say I have any experience of either
really, I just happened to browse the Wikis for fun) to mangle together
a pseudo-useful data structure for my next project.

* I learned about ctags in Vim (but not, like, how you actually
  make them useful for your project)

* I learned something about transcompilers and to be honest, they scare me a bit
(Compilers scare me too, but in a good way!)

* I started reading Ilmari Karonen's [introduction to Redcode](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html)
again and this time it started making more sense.

* I have been thinking about the Global Interpreter Lock in Python and
how one may try to circumnavigate it and what would the consequences
of that be (!!!!)

* TDD has been starting to stick on me. Esp. after I started using Pycharm.
It's just so addicting to see that green "play" button, click on it and get
the satisfying "Tests passed". Ahhh.

* I found a paper about computing confidence intervals of the AUC.
Previously, Python completely zonked on me, when I tried to implement one
of the formulas from the paper, but I think I may give it another try
this weekend (armed with numpy and scipy).

* I finally learned the difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile (yeah,
I'm slow...but hey, better late than never!)
