title: to want

I want things I don't need. I need things I don't want.
I'm addicted to checking my Twitter feed. Click, click, click. Refresh.
Log off and log right on. More meaningless scrolling, cat emojis,
an interation on the Ariana Grande 'thank u, next' meme, another rendition
of 'Ladies, if he never answers your texts' meme. 
It's meaningless, but calming. When reality offers nothing but one crisis after another,
one rejection after another, that eternally scrolling thing promises to at least to entertain.
Hey, we can't fix the world, but at least we'll have emojis, memes and GIFs to checkout while
we roast in a warming planet.
