title: dark quiet
---

_I wrote this note almost exactly two year ago - on the 25th of December, 2017 when I was visiting
Finland. The weather was crisp, the cold prickly and capricious on the skin.
But instead of being clothed in its usualy gloomy grey garb, the Christmas sky was clear.
I walked to the river that runs through a small, sleepy suburb, comfortably cradled between 
one of the highways leading to cental Helsinki and the large woodland areas of the Helsinki
Central Park. On the footbridge that crosses the river, I looked up and saw the brilliance
in the clear sky above me._

>the bridge is in darkness
an angular ice cataract covers the river
only here the dark quiet reveals the stars
