title: tell me the secret, victoria, to thy lovely (angel) bones

_CW: This post is mostly ranting about our obsession with
thinness, diet culture and the fashion model community
on YouTube - read with caution and some grains of salt._

The world of supermodel YouTube vlogs is a wild place to visit. 
I'm not even sure why I venture there, but after consuming
a seemingly endless playlist of "What I ate in a Day" accompanied
by pictures of bodies that I could never hope to attain in this lifetime, 
I can certainly say it is addicting.

Fashion models, in particular women, occupy some sort
of "success in life" pinnacle in the public imagination,
in particular in the public imagination of what it means
to be a successful "independent" woman in today's (Western) world.

Although I was a teenager in the pre-Instagram era, images of models
were dissiminated through women's magazines and early reality TV shows
like "America's Next Top Model". I was never interested in being one back then,
although the social cues around me suggested that I should. 
Unfortunately my "love of a good meal" as some perceptive, but surely well-meaning,
people observed would have precluded me from any catwalk or casting. 
These comments were always followed by the helpful encouragement
"If you lost a bit of weight, you could be a model." If I just applied
myself a little, I could also win at life. Or at least, I would be 
protected from a future as an overweight person in a highly fatphobic 
society. 

The well meaning adults that gently tried to guide me into the
warm, smothering embrace of the diet industry did not know
that the cruel pettiness of school social life had already
hammered home the point they were trying to get across. 
Being overweight at school was a paradoxical balance between being invisible and being
hypervisible.

Some events in particular were memorable.
Take the "junior prom" (or the Old's Dance as it was called
in the nativer vernacular of the place I attended high school).
I didn't get a dance partner (granted, I didn't apply myself much so
perhaps I have only myself to blame), a detail that did
not escape the attention of a senior in the same language class.
I wonder why, he said out loud during a particular quiet spell
and look at me. Though I quickly shut him up, the words made a papercut
that stung.

So to feel at least sligthly involved, slightly visible,
I decided that the least I could do, the least, because I was
incapable of being thin, beautiful and desireable enough to dance,
was to make myself useful in another way. I threw myself into work with the
prom's organizing committee and was in charge of the decorations. 

On the night of the dance, the dance hall was draped in golden
and white organza and large bows that I and a fellow dance-abstaining
friend meticulously attached to the walls. I stayed behind to watch
the dance, too. To observe the kinds of girls that got to spend a
night as a princess at a ball. It was a kind of cruel spectacle and pathetically, 
I made mental notes about how protruding their collarbones were in their gorgeous
satin, lace and tulle gowns. I made a silent vow to make my own collarbone stand out
like that. 

As life continued, small, papercut-reminders like the one above
became more and more frequent, but at least by now, I was making an
effort, I was doing something, I was participating in a culture that
claimed one could not be worthy until one's collarbones had reached
a certain prominence. 

In university, I signed up for rigorous early morning conditioning classes,
danced and swam several times a week, but oblivious to my efforts, my body
stubbornly stayed put in the unacceptable zone. I won't bore you with the details.
These kinds of accounts of slowly descending into diet hell are plentiful. 
You probably have someone close to you who has gone through this. 

### patrick wilson would never fuck you

A few years later, I was in a small student apartment, 
procrastinating by watching _Girls_ and eating
peanut butter straight out of the jar.
Seeing Hanna on screen, naked, was revolutionary yet unnerving.
Here was a woman in a body that didn't come from the same razor thin
mold and here she was, walking around in a bikini, in a bath, having
sex with a good-looking man who owned a brownstone in New York City. 

I related to Hanna, but desperately wanted to be Marnie.

In post-show Twitter discussions, the audience applauded Hanna, 
but also set clear boundaries for what a woman navigating the world
in a body like hers should be like. When the show depicted Hanna 
in an intimate relationship with Handsome Man (TM) Patrick Wilson,
Twitter went into a meltdown. It simply wasn't believable, they said,
but what they really meant was 
that a man who looked like Patrick Wilson would want to fuck a woman
with a body like Hanna's. 
Perhaps what all of these people having tweetstorm meltdowns wanted to say
was that it wasn't relatable, there were no scenes in Real Life where a man who
looked like Patrick Wilson would desire them, who more closely resembled Hanna.
At least that is how I felt. It was great to see such a leap on screen, but
I held no breaths for it happening in real life.

### the people on the pages of vogue, they're just like us

Back to the topic at hand - fashion model YouTube,
where young, beautiful and successful women jetset around the world - one night in Paris for fashion week, the next in New York for a party - 
in beautiful lithe bodies. 
Their videos have approachable titles like What I Ate in a Day (green smoothies,
lots of kale, various vitamin shots and bespoke meals prepared by professional
nutritionists), What's in my bag and Spend a Weekend with Me. 

Look, models, are ordinary people, just like us. 

Look here they are, eating a slice of pizza in New York.

Look here they are catching a red-eye to Paris to walk
a haute couture show. 

Look here they are doing crunches with a personal trainer 
who accompanies them on every trip abroad and here is a 15 minute
video of their ab-burner workout, so that you, just like them, 
can obtain chiseled abs and perhaps your life too, can be sprinkled
with a bit of glamour.

The end result of these videos is diametrically opposed
to their intention.

If only you religiously commit to drinking
green juice, going 15 minute ab burners and a 32-step
beauty routine, you too can be like them and glide down
a runway in a haute couture gown. 
In reality, few of us earn a living with our appearance 
(though most of us are certainly judged on our appearance whether we
want it or not) and can afford to have its maintenance as a second 
job.

Because the actual reality of these people remains so elusive
and unattainable, we settle for proxies of the glamour they
project. Buying the juices they drink, the moisturisers they apply
in steps 10 and 11 of their beauty routines and sign-up for ab-burner classes.
You can't buy heaven, but maybe at least a piece of it?

### they are selling the dream, you're buying the bra

Ed Razek, the curator of women's bodies for the Victoria's Secret
brand, stepped into a steaming pile by airing his antiquated views
in a recent interview with the New York Times.  
When asked why the (in)famous Victoria's Secret Fashion show doesn't
cast plussize or transwomen, he replied that the brand's job was to sell 
a dream, a fantasy and what that phrasing left unsaid, but implied, was
that neither plus-sized nor transwomen could ever be anyone's lingerie-draped
fantasy.

Perhaps one can't achieve the body of Sara Sampaio or Karlie Kloss, 
but at least one can wear the same bra and panties!

But, according to Razek, no one would ever attach such body-fantasies
to plus-size women or transwomen. Their bodies could never be used
to sell an unattainable fantasy, because their bodies weren't unattainable,
hidden behind paywalls of professional nutritionists, dermatologists and
personal trainers. Their bodies were the real lived realities of thousands
of women. 

No one would buy sexy panties modeled by an overweight woman,
Razek was saying, because no one was just buying the panties.
They were buying a piece of the fantasy of being a size 0 body,
the pinnacle of achievement for a woman.

Razek quickly found out he had been speaking to the wrong decade.
People like me, who had grown up with heroine chic and rexy, had
discovered that this was mostly bullshit. Victoria's Secret,
embroiled in one PR scandal after another, eventually
cancelled its opulent feather-laden bonanza of a fashion show and
we all discovered Victoria's ugly secret.

### the fantasy lives on

Although the fashion show may have gone underground,
the image and the fantasy these models represent lives on
in another medium, YouTube. 

Over the past decade or so, YouTube has gradually
drifted from a platform for homegrown productions
that would not necessarily get airtime in traditional media
to carefully produced "candid blogs" behind whom is often a celebrity
known from traditional media and a team of professionals. 

Many of the Victoria's Secret Angels have moved on
to become YouTubers. Their beautiful, carefully
filmed videos try to reveal the process by which one
achieves the physique necessary to participate in fashion,
to be branded by society as desireable.

We see one Angel cooking a-so-healthy-I-just-can't-even
meal with the help of her professional nutritionist against
a picturesque setting in the Hamptons.
We see another model running off to an exercise class, then to
a facial, then straight to a fitting at New York Fashion Week.

We can all relate.

We've all been there.

Why am I so addicted to consuming content that will never
even closely resemble my mundane life?

Is it so I can fantasize a bit in between running a load of
laundry and cooking dinner?

Is it an act of self-flagellation that I perform when confronted
with the billowing outlines of my own frumpy, undesireable body?

Is it so that I, too, can be inspired to take a $40 an hour
workout class and buy a $20 kale juice in a vain attempt
to optimise the market value of my appearance?

The progressive #bodyposi part of my brain 
would be horrified to admit this, but I used to be
and still am very envious of the women (it's usually
women dominating the modelling industry) who are paid
for their appearance and set the standard for the rest of us, for
whom keeping up with the demands of beauty is an unpaid fourth shift
of exercise classes and meal planning. 

In their attempt to lift the veil behind their perfect
appearances, they've managed to further distance themselves.
Who of us can manage to dedicate hours per day for exercise
and meal prep and skin care unless we are paid to do so?
It's possible to acknowledge the impossibility of their
lifestyle and yet, be haunted, by the Helena Rubinstein maxim:
"There are no ugly women, only lazy ones."
 
If only I commit myself to repeating these routines
and buying these products, I too will be acceptable
and desirable and perfect. I will have optimised my market value,
as Jia Tolentino writes in _Trick Mirror_.

And yet, somewhere deep down, I also know that this is a game
I could never win, no matter how hard I commit to memorising the
rules and practicing the moves. 

Some of my generation have started rebelling against the
confines of a narrow definition of female beauty, but even
the rebellion has become co-opted by a hastagified product
that can be packaged as a commodity and used to sell.

In the #bodypositivity Instagram community,
Instagram influencers are performing this rebellion 
by staging photos of themselves eating greasy slices of pizza, while
small, nominal stomach rolls are visible on their otherwise perfectly
toned stomachs.

Simultaneously, an invisible algorithms running on a server,
hoovers up these pictures and tags, builds a mathematical
model of how likely we are to buy exercise clothing
and kale shakes after engaging with this influencer's content,
and submits a report to some eager growth hacker or
advertising executive. 

A few months later, we will be shown an ad for a vitamin infused kale shake
just as we are lazily browsing our Insta feed. And we, remembering that image
of the influencer, will probably buy one the next time we visit our local
supermarket. The circle of life in surveillance capitalism is now complete. 

All of this happens behind the scenes, but we remain alone together
with the photo.

It's almost perfect. We can relate to this person, the influencer, their
stomach rolls, their desire for pizza, the fundamental conflict between the desire
to obliterate the former and to consume the latter. Perhaps we are also alone, at home,
on the sofa, contemplating the comfort of a greasy pizza and agonizing over our own 
stomach rolls. And the life we see mirrored in this tiny digital square made up of pixels
is almost perfect, save for one crack, one glitch in the matrix. Our rolls are much
larger, more visible. We'd have to work to reduce them, so that those rolls too would
be worthy of inclusion in a bodypositivity hashtag. 

We might never even get there, but we can buy the dream, neatly packaged
in the form of a shake, a sports top or an exercise class.

Or something close enough to it, at least.
