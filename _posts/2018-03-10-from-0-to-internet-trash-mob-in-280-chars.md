title: from 0 to internet trash mob in 280 chars

I had a bad interaction with someone I consider a role model, so I guess this is salty Sunday thoughts, but here goes anyway. 

Goodbye for now, women-in-tech Twitter community. One blog post and a whole community is getting torn apart by 
280 character hot takes. When did we lose the ability to talk about things like adults? Why can we not take criticism and disagreement and use it to become better as a community? 
I guess when we figured out that snide subtweets generate more engagement than direct conversation.

It's been a good run. The work continues - not necessarily in the scope that fits in 280 characters.
