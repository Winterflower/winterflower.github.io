# LinuxChix London is coming back!

I have an exciting announcement: I will be restarting LinuxChix meetups in the London area.
The LinuxChix community has given me a lot of wonderful support and encouragement over the
years and I would love to give something back to the community. 

I will posting details of mailing lists and Meetup pages soon!
