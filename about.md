Hello there, I'm Camilla!
I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer with an interest in building robust and testable machine learning systems.
These days my favourite programming languages are Python and Clojure (which I am still learning). I occasionally stray into Java, but I quickly get lost in the ocean of AbstractFactories. 
My favourite classifiers are support vector machines! I am currently researching how 'machine learning on the edge' would work in production. Imagine if your phone/Raspberry Pi could train a local classifier without having to transmit all of the data it collects to a central server!

I am currently working on Synbyote - a suite of tools that generate synthetic data for scenario testing of machine learning models.
