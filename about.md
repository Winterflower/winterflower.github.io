Hello and thank you very much for stopping by!
My name is Camilla and I write code (mostly in Python, sometimes Java ).
I am an active member of PyLadies London and I like exploring various cool computer science
topics in my spare time:

1. Distibuted systems
2. Machine learning (support vector machines!!!)
3. Operating systems
4. Bioinformatics

I studied Mathematics at Bryn Mawr College (just outside Philadelphia)
and Bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh.
